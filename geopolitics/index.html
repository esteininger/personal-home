                    <p>so here's the gist. i'm trying to lay out what led up to october 7th and why it matters, just connecting dots.</p>
                    <p>first off, israel was internally divided. netanyahu was consolidating power and there were mass protests. people were more split than ever. at the same time, israel and saudi arabia were getting closer to a normalization deal that would've opened up one of the most important global trade routes in the world. iran saw this as a threat to its leverage, since its economy runs on oil and gas.</p>
                    <p>iran has long been funding terror proxies like the houthis, hezbollah, isis, and hamas. these groups justify violence through religious texts and frame jihad as a holy duty. meanwhile, gaza had been flooded with aid money for decades, but much of it went into tunnels, rockets, and corruption. the top hamas leaders are billionaires while everyday gazans live in poverty.</p>
                    <p>then came october 7th. iran saw israel's vulnerability and let hamas off the leash. what followed was the deadliest day in israel's history: civilians of all backgrounds were massacred in horrific ways. terrorism against civilians has never once helped a cause, and this was no exception.</p>
                    <p>the israeli military responded with airstrikes aimed at hamas infrastructure, starting with the tunnel networks. they dropped leaflets warning civilians, but displacement was inevitable. the arab world reacted with outrage but refused to take refugees, remembering past uprisings that palestinian groups caused in jordan, lebanon, and syria.</p>
                    <p>in the west, the conversation quickly split into "oppressor vs oppressed." social media made it worse, with #freepalestine posts going viral and drowning out nuance. the internet rewards outrage, not complexity.</p>
                    <p>but the bigger picture here is global. russia wants to rebuild its soviet sphere and is waging war in ukraine. china wants taiwan and already controls critical supply chains, especially chips. iran is pushing toward nuclear weapons while still bankrolling terror. these three players together are testing the west's fractures.</p>
                    <p>the lesson from 10/7 is that enemies strike when you're divided. right now the west is deeply polarizedâ€”far left, far right, everyone fighting culture wars while foreign powers stay focused. our enemies are grittier, hungrier, and more united than we are.</p>
                    <p>the question is: are we fueling their goals by being distracted? if cohesion doesn't come soon, we're in trouble.</p>
