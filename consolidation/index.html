                    <p>over the past decade, the democratic party has undergone two big shifts: it’s moved further left on policy, and it’s become more ideologically homogeneous.</p>
                    <h3>moving further left on policy</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>healthcare:</strong> in the 1990s, democrats like clinton were pushing market-based reforms. even obama’s aca relied heavily on private insurers. now, ideas like a public option or even medicare for all are mainstream among democrats, thanks to sanders and warren. (<a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/246806/understanding-shifts-democratic-party-ideology.aspx?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gallup</a>)</li>
                        <li><strong>climate:</strong> democrats once pushed cap-and-trade or “all of the above” energy. today, the party embraces net-zero pledges and massive subsidies for clean energy through the inflation reduction act.</li>
                        <li><strong>social issues:</strong> clinton signed doma in 1996, obama campaigned in 2008 still opposing gay marriage. now, support for lgbtq rights and abortion access is absolute bedrock for the party. (<a href="https://www.americansurveycenter.org/research/the-democratic-partys-transformation-more-diverse-educated-and-liberal-but-less-religious/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">americansurveycenter</a>)</li>
                        <li><strong>immigration:</strong> democrats in the 1990s and 2000s emphasized border enforcement and deportations. today, mainstream democrats defend daca, oppose mass deportations, and frame immigration in humanitarian terms.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>polling backs this up: the american national election studies (anes) show democrats shifting left on nearly every major issue since 2012. (<a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/both-white-and-nonwhite-democrats-are-moving-left/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">center for politics</a>)</p>
                    <h3>consolidating ideologically</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>congressional votes:</strong> roll-call analysis using dw-nominate shows democrats today vote more uniformly than in decades past. the once-powerful bloc of conservative southern democrats has basically disappeared. (<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/03/10/the-polarization-in-todays-congress-has-roots-that-go-back-decades/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pew</a>)</li>
                        <li><strong>voter alignment:</strong> surveys show democratic voters are more consistent in their ideological self-identification. fewer democrats call themselves “moderate” or “conservative” compared to the 1990s. the share identifying as liberal has grown steadily and now dominates the party. (<a href="https://www.americansurveycenter.org/research/the-democratic-partys-transformation-more-diverse-educated-and-liberal-but-less-religious/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">americansurveycenter</a>)</li>
                        <li><strong>geographic uniformity:</strong> research finds democratic-leaning districts across the country now look more alike in their policy preferences. once there were big differences between, say, southern and northern democrats — now those gaps have largely collapsed. (<a href="https://newamerica.org/political-reform/reports/understanding-the-partisan-divide/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new america</a>)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>endorsements as evidence</h3>
                    <p>endorsements highlight this consolidation. governor kathy hochul, a centrist, endorsed zohran mamdani, a democratic socialist, after his primary win in new york city. on paper they couldn’t be further apart, but her endorsement reflects the reality: democrats consolidate around their nominee, even when the party’s center has moved left.</p>
                    <p>contrast that with 2021, when hochul declined to endorse india walton in buffalo after she beat the incumbent byron brown in the democratic primary. at that time, the party wasn’t ready to consolidate around someone from the far left. today, with figures like mamdani, it’s harder to say no — a sign of where the base has shifted.</p>
                    <h3>bottom line</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>policy positions on healthcare, climate, social issues, and immigration have all moved left.</li>
                        <li>congressional voting records and voter surveys show less internal diversity, more clustering.</li>
                        <li>endorsements like hochul → mamdani reveal consolidation in practice.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>taken together, democrats are becoming both <strong>more progressive and more unified</strong> than at any point in recent history.</p>
