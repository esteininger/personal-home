description: When I first got my Ford Transit rigged for vanlife, I wasn’t just building a camper—I was carving out a different relationship with freedom.

Freedom isn’t about how far I can drive in a day. It’s the small things: brewing coffee with the back doors open to the Cascade air, knowing I can point my wheels toward Leavenworth or Mammoth without clearing it with anyone, and watching Dany hop out of the van like every patch of dirt is a new backyard.

It’s also fixing solar panels on a hot roof in Oregon, or lugging water jugs through a sleepy Washington town at midnight. Those moments don’t show up on Instagram, but they’re part of what makes the freedom real—it’s earned.

## The Trade

I traded stability for motion, square footage for horizons. My Manhattan apartment never gave me the Waldo Lake paddleboard mornings, or the quiet stargazing outside Bend. The freedom of vanlife isn’t free—it costs convenience, predictability, sometimes even comfort—but the return is waking up each morning with a choice: stay, or roll.

## Why It Matters

For me, freedom is less about escape and more about alignment. The road forces minimalism, demands resourcefulness, and rewards curiosity. Each day asks: where do you want to be, Ethan? And each day, I get to answer.

That’s freedom.
