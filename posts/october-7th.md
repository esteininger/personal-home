I’ll be providing an attempted **neutral analysis** of the events leading up to the October 7th attack and the implications for an increased likelihood of WW3.  
My goal is to present the facts without assigning blame, based on referenced sources.

## Two Bubbling Activities Leading to October 7th

### Israel Divisiveness
The Prime Minister of Israel, **Benjamin Netanyahu (BiBi)**, has been pushing to consolidate power within the Knesset amidst ongoing, widespread civil protests. Israeli civilians were the most divided they had ever been.

### Israel-Saudi Relations
Normalization agreements between Israel and Saudi Arabia were getting closer to completion.  
➡️ [Britannica: Israeli-Saudi Peace Deal](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Israeli-Saudi-peace-deal)  

This would create among the most important global trade routes, connecting the Persian Gulf with the Mediterranean via Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Israel.  
➡️ [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/09/22/trade-and-security-ties-are-knitting-israel-into-its-region)

The Saudi Arabia Crown Prince, **Mohammed bin Salman (MBS)**, seeks to create a more democratic Arab world, less dependent on oil.  
➡️ [Israel Hayom](https://www.israelhayom.com/2023/08/03/the-man-who-would-be-king-of-the-arabs-say-hello-to-the-new-bin-salman/)  

With 10% of the world's oil reserves and 15% of its gas, Iran’s economic leverage would be threatened.

## Iran Terror Proxies
Iran has been funding terrorist proxies for decades.  
➡️ [PBS](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/iran-still-top-state-sponsor-terrorism-u-s-report-says)  

From Yemen’s Houthis and Lebanon’s Hezbollah to Syria’s ISIS and Palestine’s Hamas, these are radical Islamist terror groups bent on jihad. Several Hadiths state:  
> *“All sins are forgiven for those who die in the pursuit of jihad.”*  

This includes Hamas.

## Gaza Corruption
Gaza has been receiving billions annually from NATO, the U.S., Iran, and even Israel.  
➡️ [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hamas-cash-to-crypto-global-finance-maze-israels-sights-2023-10-16/)  

Pipes committed to laying down water infrastructure were repurposed into rockets.  
➡️ [The Week](https://www.theweek.in/news/world/2023/10/17/rockets-from-streetlight-poles-projectile-tubes-from-plumbing-pipes-how-hamas-makes-its-weapons.html)  

Intricate tunnel networks the size of Manhattan were used to smuggle weapons since Israel removed all civilians in 2005.  
➡️ [Wikipedia: Gaza Disengagement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_disengagement_from_Gaza)

The top 3 leaders of Hamas are now worth a combined **$11 billion**.  
➡️ [NewsNation](https://www.newsnationnow.com/world/war-in-israel/hamas-leaders-worth-billions/)

Gaza has shot a cumulative ~8,749 rockets into Israel since 2000.  
➡️ [Wikipedia: Rocket Attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_rocket_attacks_on_Israel#:~:text=From%20the%20outbreak%20of%20the,Operation%20Summer%20Rains%20(2006)%2C)

## October 7th
Iran understood that Israel’s domestic turmoil put them in a vulnerable position and unleashed Hamas to seize the opportunity by carrying out the deadliest single day in Israeli history.  
➡️ [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/10/12/hamass-attack-was-the-bloodiest-in-israels-history)

Hamas indiscriminately slaughtered everyone they could find in the most barbaric way possible. Christians, Bedouins, Thais, Germans, and Jews were among the victims.

---

## Israeli Military Response
The attack by Hamas warranted a retaliatory response from Israel’s IDF to neutralize their ability to commit the act again, which Hamas confirmed intention of.  
➡️ [Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/hamas-official-says-group-aims-to-repeat-oct-7-onslaught-many-times-to-destroy-israel/)  

The IDF began with aerial bombardment, but not before dropping **leaflets warning citizens**.  
➡️ [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/16/israel-drops-leaflets-warning-people-to-flee-southern-gaza-towns)

## Gaza Refugees
The Arab world was outraged by Israel’s response, but none accepted refugees despite shared borders. Examples from history include:  

- **Jordan (1970):** Refugees attempted to assassinate the king (Black September).  
  ➡️ [ADST](https://adst.org/2015/07/jordans-black-september-1970/)  
- **Lebanon (1975–1990):** PLO incited a civil war.  
  ➡️ [Britannica: Lebanese Civil War](https://www.britannica.com/summary/Lebanese-Civil-War#:~:text=Lebanese%20Civil%20War%2C%20(1975–,Palestine%20Liberation%20Organization%20(PLO).)  
- **Syria (2011):** Hamas supported government opposition, sparking civil war.

## Western Polarization
Universities and institutions encourage dismantling perceived oppression, often leading to reductionist *“oppressed vs oppressor”* thinking. Social media amplifies this through #freePalestine content.

## The Bigger Picture
This regional conflict is a distraction from larger global threats:

- **Russia’s Restoration of the USSR:** U.S. and NATO heavily fund Ukraine’s defense.  
  ➡️ [PBS Ukraine Aid](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/how-much-aid-the-u-s-has-sent-to-ukraine-in-6-charts#:~:text=Since%20the%20war%20began%2C%20the,Economy%2C%20a%20German%20research%20institute.)  
- **China’s “One China” Mission:** Suppression of Uyghurs, Hong Kong, Tibet; desire for Taiwan; Belt & Road expansion.  
  ➡️ [Mining Technology](https://www.mining-technology.com/news/china-metals-and-mining-investment/?cf-view)  
  ➡️ [NYT on Economy](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/25/business/china-economy-confidence.html#:~:text=What%20to%20Know%3A%20China's%20economy,has%20shaken%20the%20country's%20economy.)  
- **Iran’s Nuclear Strategy:** Desire to expand influence through nuclear capability and proxies.

## The Need for Cohesion
The lesson of 10/7: enemies will attack at your weakest moment. Polarization is rising:  

- **Far Left:** Genocidal chants like “from the river to the sea” becoming mainstream.  
  ➡️ [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_the_river_to_the_sea)  
- **Far Right:** Nationalist presidents in Argentina, Netherlands, and possibly Trump’s re-election.  

Our societies are distracted by **30-second outrage clips** while adversaries grow more united and gritty.  
Global cohesion is needed now more than ever.
