description: why real liberalism requires protecting vulnerable minorities, not pretending demographic shifts are morally neutral.

---

the debate about whether israel is “liberal” usually gets framed in this overly abstract way, like it’s just a question about whether a country should ever give one group special political protection. but the real issue isn’t abstract at all. it’s about what happens when a historically vulnerable minority loses the ability to protect itself. for jews, that story has played out the same way for two thousand years, and it’s never ended well.

a lot of arguments about israel lean on a kind of procedural purity: if the rules look identical for everyone right now, then the system is liberal, and whatever demographic shift happens next is just “democracy.” the problem is that this treats wildly different risks as if they’re symmetrical. it pretends that a jewish minority in an arab-majority state faces the same stakes as any other group in any other context. history says otherwise, loudly.

liberalism isn’t just about majority rule. it’s about preventing the majority from stripping the minority of safety and rights. that’s why real democracies build in all kinds of asymmetric protections: constitutional guarantees, minority vetoes, courts that can override the majority, power-sharing agreements, federalism. these aren’t weird exceptions. they’re the backbone of modern liberal systems. they exist because power isn’t evenly distributed and history isn’t neutral.

when people say israel should be perfectly “identity-blind,” even if that means a future majority could vote away jewish self-determination, that’s not liberalism. that’s majoritarianism dressed up as fairness. a system that allows a vulnerable minority to be democratically erased isn’t morally superior — it’s just naive about how power works.

the core point isn’t that jews deserve special rights because they’re special. it’s that some groups, because of their history and the threats they face, require structural guarantees to avoid catastrophe. every serious democracy already acknowledges this principle. ignoring it in israel’s case doesn’t make the argument more principled. it just makes it less honest.

you can’t protect a minority by pretending history doesn’t exist. real liberalism doesn’t demand that. it demands the opposite: building guardrails strong enough that the people most at risk don’t get crushed the second the numbers shift.

that’s what the entire argument turns on. liberal values aren’t upheld by worshipping procedures. they’re upheld by protecting people.
