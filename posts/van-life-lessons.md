After six months of van life with my Australian Shepherd, I've learned more about minimalism and freedom than any book could teach.

## The Reality vs. The Instagram

Van life isn't all sunset beaches and mountain views. It's also:

- Finding water at 2 AM
- Debugging solar panel issues
- Teaching your dog that the van is home, not every tree

But these challenges make the freedom even sweeter.

## Essential Gear

```Solar: 400W panels + 200Ah battery
Water: 20 gallon tank + filtration
Tech: Starlink + portable workstation
Dog: One very good boy
```

## The Best Part

Waking up to a different view every morning never gets old. Whether it's the Pacific coastline or a hidden forest grove, each day brings new perspectivesâ€”literally and figuratively.
