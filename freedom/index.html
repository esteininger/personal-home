                    <p>during covid i decided to build out a camper van. i wanted something that wasn't just a car with a bed thrown in the back, but a real little home and office on wheels. i put in a kitchen, a sink, a spot to work with internet, even a small bathroom setup. then came the fun stuff—mountain bike, stand-up paddleboard, backpacking gear, hiking gear. basically everything i'd need to live, work, and play without relying on hotels, restaurants, or rentals.</p>
                    <p>the way i use it now is simple: i fly out to wherever the van is parked—usually tucked away in someone's driveway that i pay monthly rent for—grab my dog, and hit the road. i'll spend a stretch exploring trails, lakes, and mountains, then drop it back off in the driveway and fly home. the only real expense is the flight. no hotel bills, no car rentals, no daily eating out. just my gear, my dog, and the open road.</p>
                    <p>what's cool is every day i get a new backyard. one morning i can paddleboard on a quiet lake, the next i'm mountain biking in the woods, or heading up a trail with my pack. it's a constant switch-up that balances perfectly with the chaos of manhattan. it feels like the best travel hack i've ever pulled off.</p>
